# M5-accuracy-competition

This is our final project of class Responsible Machine Learning where we use Python platform to apply machine learning techniques covered in the course to analyze realistic datasets. 

We will work on hierarchical sales data from Walmart, the worldâ€™s largest company by revenue, to forecast daily sales for the next 28 days. The data, covers stores in three US States (California, Texas, and Wisconsin) and includes item level, department, product categories, and store details. In addition, it has explanatory variables such as price, promotions, day of the week, and special events. Together, this robust dataset can be used to improve forecasting accuracy

To make the prediction, in this notebook a gradient boosting machine (GBM) is trained to predict demand of customers on different types of products in different Walmart stores in three different states using given variables, Python, NumPy, Pandas, and XGBoost. This combination of monotonic XGBoost, partial dependence, ICE, and Shapley explanations is probably the most direct way to create an interpretable machine learning model today.

We believe that out work will continue to advance the theory and practice of forecasting. The methods used can be applied in various business areas, such as setting up appropriate inventory or service levels.
